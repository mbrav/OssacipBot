# OssacipBot
*I love art. Random is my type of order.*

## Abstract

This bot explores the boundaries of authorship of artwork generated by autonomous systems. When an autonomous system begins to to have a decent form of computational creativity, a re-examination of its copyright standards might also be necessary. On the other hand, what is the limit of what we define an agent that produces artwork “decent” enough to have a to a copyright attribution? If art extends beyond the boundaries of an expressive performing artifact, *art* might define just  about any object/visual that has been subjected to manipulation.

The technologies behind this piece allow the bot autonomously generate procedural artwork for an indefinite amount of time with near limitless combinations. The bot produces visuals with a form of marvel that might allow it to have certain artistic qualities. Ossacip Bot however, might not seem to posses the justifiable quality of uniqueness that can formally approve its artisitc potential. It’s inner functioning is exposed to the internet which allow it to have an indefinite amount of instances. Someone may choose to create millions instance the same bots and flood the internet with generated GIFs.

The question that welcomes an answer, is what is the boundary between the *artifice* and the *material* when it comes to artwork produced by autonomous systems. Is expression a necessary prerequiste for defining an artwork? Given the fact that objects with no intellect do not have the potential to produce an intelligible artist’s statement, can an autonomous system even have the right for authorship?

## Fractal Formula
The formula is bases on the notion of mathematical [Dynamical Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system). The bot randomizes 6 different variables called *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, and *f*. One of these variables is randomly chosen to have its value dynamically manipulated allowing the formula to produce "movement" to the exported GIF. Then hundred of thousands points are drawn per frame with the following coordinates:

### Installation
This is the installation procedure that was followed on a Ubuntu server setup. The procedure however is different on systems like mac OS and Windows.

Clone the repository using git
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mbrav/OssacipBot.git
```

Enter into the repository

```
$ cd OssacipBot
```

Allow the server setup script to be executable, then run it

```
$ sudo chmod +x server-setup.sh && ./server-setup.sh
```

Now its time to test the bot.
Enter into the ```node``` folder and install dependencies like so:

```
$ cd node && npm install
```

**NOTE:** Add your own twitter API keys to the ```node/config.js``` file. If you have a Twitter account, you can get your [Twitter API here](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Run the server!
```
$ node bot.js
```

### Processing 3 Requirements
If the script fails to install the dependencies automatically, the following Processing 3 libraries can be installed manually:
