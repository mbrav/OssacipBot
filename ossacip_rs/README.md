Ossacip implementation in Rust through library nannou

## Cargo

    -   `cargo init` Create a new project for the latest edition.
    -   `cargo build` Build the project in debug mode (--release for all optimization).
    -   `cargo check` Check if project would compile (much faster).
    -   `cargo test` Run tests for the project.
    -   `cargo doc --open` Locally generate documentation for your code and dependencies.
    -   `cargo run` Run your project, if a binary is produced (main.rs). --release for all optimization.
    -   `cargo run -p` w Run main of sub-workspace w. Treats features more as you would expect.
    -   `cargo tree` Show dependency graph.
    -   `cargo +{nightly, stable}` ... Use given toolchain for command, e.g., for 'nightly only' tools.
    -   `cargo +nightly ...` Some nightly-only commands (substitute ... with command below)
    -   `build -Z` timings Show what crates caused your build to take so long, highly useful. ðŸš§ ðŸ”¥
    -   `rustc -- -Zunpretty=expanded` Show expanded macros. ðŸš§
    -   `rustup doc` Open offline Rust documentation (incl. the books), good on a plane!
